# Seeding Data for New Installations

HuduGlue includes comprehensive seed data to help you get started immediately:

- **Equipment Catalog**: 3,000+ models across Dell, HP, Lenovo, Cisco, and other major vendors
- **Knowledge Base Articles**: 1,000+ professional IT documentation articles across 20+ categories

## Quick Start

### Seed Everything (Recommended for New Installations)

```bash
cd /path/to/huduglue
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py seed_all --from-github
```

This will:
- Create 3,000+ equipment models with specs
- Fetch 1,000+ KB articles from GitHub
- Take approximately 2-5 minutes

### Seed Specific Data

#### Equipment Catalog Only
```bash
python manage.py seed_equipment_catalog
```

#### KB Articles from GitHub (Recommended)
```bash
python manage.py fetch_kb_from_github
```

This fetches curated KB articles from the HuduGlue GitHub repository.

#### KB Articles Locally Generated
```bash
python manage.py seed_kb_articles
```

Generates articles locally (slower, use GitHub fetch instead).

### Quick Seed (For Testing)
```bash
python manage.py seed_all --quick
```

Creates limited data for testing (5 articles per category).

## Deleting Existing Data

To replace existing seed data:

```bash
# Delete and re-seed everything
python manage.py seed_all --delete

# Delete and re-seed equipment only
python manage.py seed_equipment_catalog --delete

# Delete and re-seed KB articles only
python manage.py seed_kb_articles --delete
```

## Managing Seed Data

### Users Can Delete Unwanted Data

All seed data can be safely deleted by users:

**Equipment Models:**
- Navigate to Assets > Equipment Catalog
- Delete vendors or individual models not needed

**KB Articles:**
- Navigate to Knowledge Base
- Archive or delete articles not relevant

**Note:** Deleting seed data does NOT affect user-created content.

### Customizing Seed Data

To customize what gets seeded, edit:
- `/home/administrator/assets/management/commands/seed_vendor_data.py` (equipment)
- `/home/administrator/docs/management/commands/seed_kb_articles.py` (KB articles)

## Best Practices

1. **New Installations**: Run `seed_all` immediately after initial setup
2. **Testing**: Use `--quick` flag for faster testing environments
3. **Production**: Keep seed data - it's valuable reference material
4. **Updates**: Re-run seeding with `--delete` to refresh data
5. **Backups**: Seed data can always be regenerated

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found"
Make sure you're in the correct directory and virtual environment is activated.

### Seeding Takes Too Long
- Use `--quick` for testing
- Run during off-hours for production
- Equipment catalog: ~2-3 minutes
- KB articles: ~3-5 minutes
- Total: ~5-10 minutes

### Out of Memory
Increase available RAM or use `--quick` mode.

### Database Errors
- Ensure migrations are up to date: `python manage.py migrate`
- Check database connections
- Verify disk space

## Support

For issues with seed data:
1. Check logs: `tail -f /var/log/itdocs/gunicorn-error.log`
2. Report issues: https://github.com/anthropics/huduglue/issues
3. Community support: Check documentation wiki

## Version Information

Seed data is updated regularly. Check `CHANGELOG.md` for what's new in each release.

Current seed data versions:
- Equipment Catalog: v1.5 (3,000+ models)
- KB Articles: v1.0 (1,000+ articles)

# Optional Directory Services Integration
# 
# These packages are only needed if you want to use LDAP/Active Directory integration.
# They require system build tools and libraries to compile.
#
# To install:
#   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev
#   source venv/bin/activate
#   pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
#
# Note: Azure AD SSO does NOT require these packages (uses msal instead)
